# Idea.AI — Luddy Hackathon Project (April 2025)

**Role:** Full-stack developer (LLM integration, backend, ranking logic)  
**Tech:** Node.js, Express, React, Docker, Ollama (Mistral LLM)  
**Team Size:** 4

Idea.AI is a tool that helps teams evaluate and prioritize ideas using Mistral through Ollama. The app scores ideas based on customizable ROI and Effort metrics, then ranks them using a dynamic, weight-driven algorithm exposed through a clean React UI.

- Helped teammates adopt React effectively for the first time

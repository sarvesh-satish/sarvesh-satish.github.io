  I’m a junior at Indiana University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Business. From an early age, I was drawn to technology, whether it was optimizing game performance or troubleshooting tech issues for my family, I enjoyed solving problems and seeing the impact firsthand. This passion naturally led me to computer science, where I thrive on tackling challenges and building solutions.

  Throughout my coursework, I’ve gained experience in Python, Java, C, React, and more, applying these skills to both academic and personal projects. Beyond technical expertise, I’ve taken on leadership roles in student organizations, strengthening my ability to collaborate and drive initiatives forward. I’m eager to continue growing my technical and leadership skills, exploring opportunities where I can contribute and innovate.

          Full-stack AI idea-ranking tool built with Mistral via Ollama. Created during the Luddy Hackathon.
        description: |
          Built a full-stack application that uses Ollama’s Mistral LLM to evaluate, rank, and prioritize ideas based on ROI and Effort metrics. Implemented a dynamic weight-based scoring system so users can fine-tune AI criteria and receive data-driven recommendations.

          Contributed backend development using Node.js and Express, integrated Docker for consistent shared environments, and helped the team adopt React for the first time. Overcame LLM integration challenges and delivered a functional prototype under hackathon constraints.

          Selected as 1 of 150 interns from over 4,000 applicants to help build internal engineering tools powering teams across the company.
        description: |
          Extended an internal K6 accelerator by building and integrating over 5 new features, including automated test triggering through GitHub Actions. This reduced manual effort and improved load-test coverage for more than a dozen engineering teams.

          Designed and implemented a migration script that moved projects from LoadRunner Enterprise to LoadRunner Cloud, saving roughly 5 hours per project across 16 projects (over 80 total hours). This solved a vendor-declared limitation using custom scripting and pipeline automation.

          Earned 3rd place out of 25+ teams at the intern hackathon by creating a tool that analyzes Git branches and alerts developers of potential merge conflicts across teams, improving collaboration and reducing integration issues.

        sub_title: B.S. in Computer Science • Minor in Business • GPA 3.75/4.00
        quote: >
          Focused on software engineering, systems programming, mobile development, and business fundamentals through a mix of technical coursework and applied projects.
        description: |
          At Indiana University, I built a strong foundation in computer science with coursework in systems programming, data structures, software engineering, web development, and mobile app development. I combined this with a business minor that strengthened my understanding of strategy, operations, and organizational decision-making.

          Outside of the classroom, I worked on several semester-long engineering projects, participated in hackathons, and held leadership roles in professional organizations such as Phi Gamma Nu. These experiences helped me develop collaboration skills, technical depth, and a practical approach to building software.

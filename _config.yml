about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I’m a junior at Indiana University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Business. From an early age, I was drawn to technology, whether it was optimizing game performance or troubleshooting tech issues for my family, I enjoyed solving problems and seeing the impact firsthand. This passion naturally led me to computer science, where I thrive on tackling challenges and building solutions.

  Throughout my coursework, I’ve gained experience in Python, Java, C, React, and more, applying these skills to both academic and personal projects. Beyond technical expertise, I’ve taken on leadership roles in student organizations, strengthening my ability to collaborate and drive initiatives forward. I’m eager to continue growing my technical and leadership skills, exploring opportunities where I can contribute and innovate.

        title: Smart Campus Navigation (AI Search & Heuristic Analysis)
        quote: >
          Spring 2025 • CSCI-B 351 (Artificial Intelligence)<br>
          Tech: Python, A*, Dijkstra, OpenStreetMap, graph search, heuristics<br>
          Role: Algorithm design, heuristic analysis, benchmarking
        description: |
          Built an AI-driven campus navigation system that computes optimal walking routes using classical search algorithms. The project models real campus pathways as a weighted graph and evaluates how heuristic choice impacts performance in A* search.
          
          **My Contributions:**

          🔹 **Graph Modeling & Pathfinding**
          - Modeled campus buildings and walkways as a weighted graph using OpenStreetMap data
          - Implemented Dijkstra’s and A* search to compute optimal routes between locations

          🔹 **Heuristic Design & Evaluation**
          - Implemented and compared Haversine (great-circle) and Euclidean heuristics for A*
          - Demonstrated ~72% fewer node expansions and ~2.4× runtime improvement over Dijkstra with an admissible heuristic

          🔹 **Algorithmic Analysis**
          - Analyzed time and space complexity and validated optimality guarantees
          - Showed how poor heuristic choice can eliminate A*’s performance advantages

        title: Merge Conflict Detector (Liberty Mutual Intern Hackathon)
        quote: >
          Summer 2025 • 3rd of 25+ teams<br>
          Tech: Python, GitHub API, Git automation, CI tooling, GitHub webhooks<br>
          Role: Backend + repository analysis logic
        description: |
          Built a tool to detect likely merge conflicts before they break CI or slow collaboration. It analyzes branches across multiple repositories using the GitHub API, measures drift, and alerts engineers when patterns suggest future conflicts.

          **My Contributions:**

          🔹 **Merge Conflict Detection Logic**
          - Built webhook-triggered backend logic to detect merge conflicts on repository push events
          - Generated Git compare URLs to give engineers immediate visibility into conflicting changes

          🔹 **Backend APIs & Integration**
          - Implemented REST endpoints to deliver structured conflict data to the Slack bot
          - Defined payload formats and contracts used by the notification layer
          
          🔹 **Pitch & Demo**
          - Co-led the project pitch and live demo that placed 3rd out of 25+ teams

          Note: Repository is private to Liberty Mutual for security reasons.

          Full-stack AI idea-ranking tool built with Mistral via Ollama.<br>
          Role: Full-stack developer (LLM integration, backend, ranking logic)<br>
          Tech: Node.js, Express, React, Docker, Ollama (Mistral LLM)<br>
          Team Size: 4
        description: |
          Idea.AI is a tool that helps teams evaluate and prioritize ideas using Mistral through Ollama. The app scores ideas based on customizable ROI and Effort metrics, then ranks them using a dynamic, weight-driven algorithm exposed through a clean React UI.

          **My Contributions:**

          🔹 **AI Evaluation Pipeline**
          - Integrated Ollama's Mistral model and built the custom prompt workflow
          - Implemented the algorithm that evaluates ideas based on ROI/Effort

          🔹 **Dynamic Ranking System**
          - Added adjustable weight sliders to prioritize ROI, Effort, or balance both
          - Connected real-time updates from UI -> backend -> LLM -> frontend

          🔹 **Backend & Infrastructure**
          - Built Express API routes for evaluation, ranking, and agent logic
          - Helped teammates adopt React effectively for the first time

        sub_title: Software Engineering Intern
        caption: Summer 2025 – Indianapolis, IN
        quote: >
          Selected as 1 of 150 interns from over 4,000 applicants to help build internal engineering tools powering teams across the company.
        description: |
          Extended an internal K6 accelerator by building and integrating over 5 new features, including automated test triggering through GitHub Actions. This reduced manual effort and improved load-test coverage for more than a dozen engineering teams.

          Designed and implemented a migration script that moved projects from LoadRunner Enterprise to LoadRunner Cloud, saving roughly 5 hours per project across 16 projects (over 80 total hours). This solved a vendor-declared limitation using custom scripting and pipeline automation.

          Earned 3rd place out of 25+ teams at the intern hackathon by creating a tool that analyzes Git branches and alerts developers of potential merge conflicts across teams, improving collaboration and reducing integration issues.

        title: Indiana University — Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering
        caption: May 2027
        sub_title: B.S. in Computer Science • Minor in Business • GPA 3.75/4.00
        quote: >
          Focused on software engineering, systems programming, mobile development, and business fundamentals through a mix of technical coursework and applied projects.
        description: |
          At Indiana University, I built a strong foundation in computer science with coursework in systems programming, data structures, software engineering, web development, and mobile app development. I combined this with a business minor that strengthened my understanding of strategy, operations, and organizational decision-making.

          Outside of the classroom, I worked on several semester-long engineering projects, participated in hackathons, and held leadership roles in professional organizations such as Phi Gamma Nu. These experiences helped me develop collaboration skills, technical depth, and a practical approach to building software.
